# Sanjeevinibot
Sanjeevini Bot is an intelligent chatbot designed to assist users with health-related queries. It provides medicine suggestions, AI-generated responses, and answers frequently asked health questions.

# Overview
    The Chatbot-GUI is a user-friendly interface that enables seamless interactions with a chatbot using visual elements like text boxes, menus, and buttons. This project combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques with Tkinter for GUI development, making it a versatile tool for interactive communication.

# Key Functionalities
    Text Input & Output: Users can type queries in a text box, and responses are displayed in the interface.
    AI-Powered Responses: Leverages NLP and machine learning to generate relevant replies.
    Medicine Suggestions: Provides medicine recommendations based on user input.
    Add Medicine Information: Allows users to expand the chatbotâ€™s knowledge base by adding new medicine-condition pairs.
    Interactive Greetings & FAQs: Responds to greetings and frequently asked questions.
    Expandable Features: Supports voice recognition, text-to-speech, and sentiment analysis.

# How It Works
The chatbot is built using:

Tkinter: For creating graphical elements like buttons, menus, and input fields.
NLTK: For tokenization, lemmatization, and processing natural language.
CSV Module: To store and retrieve medicine-condition pairs.
OpenAI API: For generating advanced AI-powered responses.
